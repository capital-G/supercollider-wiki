(in this example the username is `JohnDoe` and SuperCollider repository was checked out inside `sc-dev` directory, replace those with yours) 

#### OSX:

- include paths:

`/Users/JohnDoe/sc-dev/supercollider/SCClassLibrary`

- exclude paths:

`/Users/JohnDoe/sc-dev/supercollider/build/Install/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/SCClassLibrary`

#### Linux:

- include paths:

`/home/JohnDoe/sc-dev/supercollider/SCClassLibrary`

- exclude paths:

`/usr/local/share/SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary`
