How to maintain this changelog
==============================

This changelog documents the publicly visible changes since the most recent SuperCollider release. A change is worth putting here if it affects users, such as breaking changes (of course), new features, and bug fixes. Significant refactors should also be logged to identify areas that should be tested, and to help locate the culprit in case of breakage. Documentation edits generally shouldn't be on this list, but major overhauls and expansions may be appropriate.

The website [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/) is a major inspiration for the organization of the changelog. Changes to each component of SuperCollider are subdivided into Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, and Security, in that order.

Please provide the link to the PR with every entry in the changelog for easy navigation.

Try to exercise common sense in keeping this log readable and useful to users. Use complete sentences and, to a reasonable extent, err on the side of clarity. In case of doubt, prefer inclusion over exclusion.

General: Added
-----

A `NO_X11` option has been added to the build system so that server plugins requiring an X server such as MouseX can be omitted ([#3738](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3738)).

General: Changed
-------

sclang and scide have long been stuck with Qt 5.5 due to Qt dropping QtWebKit for QtWebEngine. They have been upgraded for compatibility with Qt 5.7+. We recommend using the most recent version of Qt. The impacts of this change include:

- sclang and scide now build on Visual Studio 2015 and later. (Previously, Windows users had to obtain the now-ancient Visual Studio 2013.)
- UserView now supports Retina/HiDPI display.
- A somewhat different build process on Linux. See the README.

The minimum required version is now CMake 3.5 instead of CMake 2.8 ([#3656](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3656)).

scel (the emacs package) is now a submodule ([#3519](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3519)).

General: Fixed
-----

Many issues with Unicode paths on Windows were fixed in 3.9. A few remaining cases involving sound files remained, and are now fixed ([#3720](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3720)):

- supernova's sound file backend, buffer manager, and plugin loading
- NRT mode in scsynth
- `/b_read` family of commands in scsynth
- `SoundFileView` in the sclang GUI

Fixed a build failure with the CMake option `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP=on` ([#3558](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3558)).

Fixed a misleading deprecation warning when `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set to the home directory in Linux ([#3613](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3613)).

scsynth and supernova: Added
-----

supernova now has latency compensation ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).

scsynth and supernova: Fixed
-----

scsynth's latency compensation had a math error that ended up doubling the latency. It is fixed now ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).

UGens: Added

sclang: Added
-----

Added wrappers for over 100 special mathematical functions (gamma function, Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, etc.) from the Boost library ([#3672](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3672)).

`FileDialog` and `Dialog` now support a "path" argument that specifies a default directory when the dialog appears ([#3508](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3508)).

`QTreeView` has a new method: `setColumnWidth` ([#3560](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3560)).

sclang: Changed
-------

**Breaking change:** `Float:asString` now always produces a decimal point, so `3.0.asString` is now `"3.0"` instead of `"3"` ([#3585](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3585)).

**Breaking change:** The `server` argument has changed to `target` in `Function:asBuffer`, `Function:loadToFloatArray`, and `Function:plot`, and now allows spawning the plotting synth relative to a group or node rather than just a server ([#3088](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3088)).

Scrollbars now always appear for ScrollView on Linux an Windows, as a temporary workaround for a very odd dependency on the use of the scroll wheel ([#3686](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3686)).

sclang: Deprecated
----------

sclang: Removed
-------

Removed some unused Qt dependencies from the build system ([#3472](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3472)).

sclang: Fixed
-----

**Breaking change:** Fixed a long-standing math error in `SimpleNumber:expexp` ([#3786](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3786)).

Fixed extreme CPU usage of sclang when built without Qt ([#3772](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3772)).

On Windows, the directory where extensions were installed was accidentally changed in 3.9. It has been reverted ([#3751](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3751)).

Fixed a crash when calling `File.copy` when the destination exists ([#3633](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3633)).

Fixed two `Array:lace` issues: a crash when any element is an empty array, and an error when no length argument is provided and any element is not an array ([#3716](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3716)).

Fixed conditions where `Integer:forBy` can cause sclang to freeze when the step size is 0 or a floating point value with an absolute value less than 1 ([#3804](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3804)).

Fixed some incorrect output in `FunctionDef:dumpByteCodes` ([#3803](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3803)).

Class library: Added
-----

`UnitTest.passVerbosity` allows changing the verbosity of test failure reports. See the `UnitTest` help file for more information ([#3615](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3615)).

Added new UGen methods `.snap` and `.softRound` ([#3429](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3429/files)).

`Node:query` has a new `action` argument, allowing specification of a callback function ([#3701](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3701)).

Class library: Changed
-------

Internal calls to `.interpret` have been removed from `Color.fromHexString` and `History.unformatTime`, improving both performance and security ([#3527](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3527)).

Class library: Deprecated
----------

Class library: Removed
-------

Class library: Fixed
-----

`BufWr.ar` no longer allows its input signals to be control rate, causing the server to read from garbage memory ([#3749](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3749)).

`Buffer:query` returned incorrect results if multiple query messages are sent at once. This has been fixed ([#3645](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3645)).

Fixed fragilities in path joining methods such as `+/+`, `withTrailingSlash`, and `withoutTrailingSlash` ([#3634](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3634)).

Fixed bugs when certain pattern classes are passed in 0 as the number of repeats ([#3603](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3603)).

Fixed `Event.addEventType` ignoring the `parentEvent` argument ([#3736](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3736)).

Fixed `Pkey` being skipped because the default number of repeats is `nil` instead of `inf` ([#3724](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3724)).

Fixed some harmless but annoying errors about extensions of nonexistent classes when sclang is built without Qt ([#3770](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3770)).

`ProxySpace:linkDoc` was broken â€” switching documents did not actually change ProxySpaces. This is fixed now ([#3764](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3764)).

`Recorder:prepareForRecord` produced an error if the recordings path does not exist. It now makes the directory if it doesn't exist ([#3788](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3788)).

Fixed bugs when providing multiple paths in `ServerOptions:ugensPluginPath` ([#3754](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3754)).
