# notes for the 3.13 release, to be included in Changelog.md

### Plotter: update default colors to valid colors. #4511
PR removes the Plotter -gui method; the call is now propagated to the parent classes and returns an ObjectGui

### Plugins: Integrator Ctor passes through the first sample only #5352
Prior to v3.13, there was a bug that caused the Integrator to double-count the initial value. Prefviously, the integral of a single 1 followed by endless 0s ends up being 2. Starting with v.3.13, it's 1 as expected.
