# notes for the 3.13 release, to be included in Changelog.md

### sclang

#### Plotter
- Update default colors to valid colors. [#4511](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4511)
  - PR removes the `Plotter:-gui` method; the call is now propagated to the parent classes and returns an `ObjectGui`
- Grid lines and their labels are improved, along with axis labels, which are now settable by their own methods `labelX_` and `labelY_`. The x-axis label inherits the `units` of a `domainSpec` if it is explicitly set and `labelX` hasn't already been set. [#5827](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5827)

#### Spawner -seq
- Changed: argument name changed to `pattern`

### Plugins 

#### UGen initialization 
- Numerous UGens have been updated so that their initialization sample is set correctly. The majority of these fixes are in the collection of oscillators, etc. found in `OscUGens.cpp`. [#5787](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5787), [#5817](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5817)

- `Integrator` Ctor passes through the first sample only [#5352](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5352)

   Prior to v3.13, there was a bug that caused the Integrator to double-count the initial value: the integral of a single 1 followed by endless 0s ends up being 2. Starting with v.3.13, it's 1 as expected.

- `Impulse` is now initialized correctly ([#4150](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4150)) such that: 
  - it will fire on the first sample, given the default phase of 0 (or multiple of 1).
  - a frequency of 0 fires once and only once on the first sample (unless the frequency subsequently changes).
  - negative frequencies and phases are now supported and phase of any value is wrapped into range.

   These are intended and documented behaviors, but which failed previously in certain UGen configurations. Therefore, _users may observe changes to the initial state of synth graphs that use Impulse. (Especially triggered UGens.)_

### Other
#### Update macOS build matrix [#5845](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5845)
On macOS the main build supports macOS 10.14 and up. Legacy build still supports 10.10 and up, which means that 10.13 users should use the legacy build.
