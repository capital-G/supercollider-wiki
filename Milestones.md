We use four tags to keep track of issues:

- Next patch (example: "3.9.1")
- Some patch (example: "3.9.x")
- Next minor (example: "3.10")
- Some minor (example: "3.x")

Patch-milestoned issues are those that will require bug fixes, while minor-milestoned issues are things like new
features and major changes that are better left for a minor release. The "Next patch"/"Next minor" milestones mark those
issues that we've decided _must_ be addressed before the next respective release. They're either the most painful bugs
or most requested features.

When, in the example milestones above, 3.10 is released, we would move all 3.9.x-milestoned issues to 3.10.x,
and then collectively decide which issues ought to move from 3.x to 3.11 and from 3.10.x to 3.10.1.
