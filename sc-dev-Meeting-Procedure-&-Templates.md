Some message templates and reminders for how we do dev meetings. Edit at will.

- send out a poll early in the week (Tuesday or Wednesday): sc-dev, Slack, scsynth.org.
- announce the time (Thursday or Friday): sc-dev, Slack, scsynth.org.
- post minutes ASAP after the meeting: GitHub, sc-dev, scsynth.org. **Always post minutes, even if uneventful.**

The announcements should be posted on sc-dev, Slack, and scsynth.org.

# Conducting meetings

Make sure someone takes minutes! (Also mute your mic when typing so it doesn't disturb conversation.)

If there are any people new to the dev meetings, give them a warm welcome and have them introduce themselves, ask what they do with SC, etc.

Typically (unless there is something more pressing) we kick off by having everyone summarize what they did in the past week of development, and see if that sparks any discussions.

Meetings are **90 minutes long**. Be respectful of people's time and try not to go over that!
