The helpfile [Writing Unit Generators](http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/WritingUGens.html) covers what you need in order to create a UGen plugin (including Xcode instructions for those on Mac).  
Plugins are dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs) written in C++.

The official [SuperCollider Book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/supercollider-book) has a chapter `Writing Unit Generator Plug-ins` by Dan Stowell.
