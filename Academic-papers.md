There have been many academic papers and book chapters published that discuss SuperCollider as a whole, or systems implemented in SuperCollider.

This article describes a research tool for voice scientists and voice educators. It is free for download and further modification, subject to European Public License v1.2. and full citation of this article. There is a Handbook for users, and a large number of integrated SC Help files, for SC developers wanting to understand the classes. FonaDyn has about a dozen custom UGens, some of which are of general interest, especially those for fast server->client transfer of multiple data streams in parallel. The current release is compatible with SuperCollider versions up to 3.8.x only. Several scientific studies using this tool are in progress (2018).
