**Tutorials.** SuperCollider is notorious for being tough to learn, and the decrepit state of our official tutorial isn't helping. The user community has stepped up with some great learning resources, but many of them are out of date, inconsistent with each other in style, or not sufficiently advanced. A project simply known as "[Learn SC](https://github.com/supercollider/learn)" represents a new community effort to create an official SC book.

**sclang: Improvements to error messages.** Error messages are just very ugly looking and often contain far more information than is necessary. Fortunately, the issues are largely cosmetic and can be addressed with very little effort.

**Debian packaging.** Ubuntu packages are terribly out of date, and nobody currently knows how to maintain our own PPA.
