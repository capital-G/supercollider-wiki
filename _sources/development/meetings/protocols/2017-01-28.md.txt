What we worked on:
- Tom Murphy worked on a minor control bus issue (issue 1280) and has been assigning trustworthiness labels to UGens.
- Alberto de Campo has three ongoing projects: multiclient server, improving node ID allocation, and improving the Quarks system so one can trace the quark associated to a given class.
- Nathan Ho did nothing aside from some small help fixes.
- Brian Heim sketched out verbosity levels in sclang.

Topics:
- Potential compatibility issues with the node ID allocation refactor
- Definition of sample-rate independence for UGens
- Automated testing pool for UGens
- Regression tests for the parser and lexer
- SourceForge must die
- Post-3.9, consider expanding our set of filters and reverbs
- Assigning a theme to each release and/or a funny name
- Making Boost a submodule, such as using the boost library instead of fopen
- Brian's ongoing PyrLexer rewrite
