Members present: Nathan, Patrick

- Nathan hasn't done much
- Patrick looked for a solution for the UnitTesting conflict bug and found that quarks has a "compatibility" feature which we could use
- We discussed a new issue with [scel](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4074) helpbrowser loading failure
- We delisted [#3869](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3869) from 3.10 since its urgency is not clear
- Three issues remain before 3.10.0-rc1 is to be released:
  - Ndef fadein
  - Syntax colors affect IDE colors
  - keyDownAction message
