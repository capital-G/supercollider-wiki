    - Patrick: not much SC work lately
- Discussed new jack2 release for macOS (replacing JackOSX)
- 3.11.2 release
    - overall on track
    - need to fix portaudio/cmake issue (#5176)
    - need to make cherry pick PRs
    - discussed #5188 - does not need to be fixed for 3.11.2
    - discussed #4883 - Brian will review soon
    - still planning for release date in October or November
    - discussed #5110 - agreed better for 3.12
- 3.12.0 release
    - planning to release before the end of the year
    - already have enough to do a release
    - #5081 is a nice-to-have
    - maybe Bela support if it starts moving forward soon
- pair/group code review sessions
    - informal group call to review PRs together
    - did first one last week with Brian, Gianluca, James S
    - should have someone else besides Brian "driving" next time (next weekend probably)
    - send out an announce/invite to more channels if the next one goes well
- big list/board/prioritization
    - want to have some way to organize top-level issues/projects/concerns
    - where to put it?
        - Discourse vs Github projects vs Github wikis vs other places?
    - milestones? make it easier to see what goes into what release
    - hard to use tools GitHub gives us to manage project easily
    - look into bots for automation? / external integration
    - maybe even a new GitHub repo for "meta-issues" / organization?
    - agreed to dump into a wiki page for now and see how that works out
- Bela
    - discussed merge of Bela into SC and the difficulties involved -- everyone wants it, just takes some time
    - Gianluca and Patrick offered to help with the merge & testing
    - CI job is probably possible since it can be cross-compiled
- help browser
    - Marcin suggested it might be possible to avoid using QtWebEngine for the help browser by using a text view instead
    - discussed some possible implementation issues
