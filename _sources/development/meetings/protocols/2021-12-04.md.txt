For next dev meeting: discuss moving to Qt6

Discussion on Windows builds for newer hardware (SSE4-capable), also on 32-bit shift

Discussion on name suffix on dev branch (https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5566) - we decided to do it and use `-dev` suffix  
Nathan made an experiment and the merge conflict this PR would introduce would only be needed to resolve once on the first merge from a new release branch.

Discussion on MainMenu memory leak discussed on the forum - this was solved some time ago (3.10.2 ?)
