Members Present:

Patrick, Nathan

Recent work:

- Patrick has been removing some old crap on the website
- Nathan has been refactoring the new reverb for efficiency

Topics:

- 3.9.1 announcement delay
- Recent advances in Debian packaging
- Timing of introduction of scel and Ableton Link submodules
- 3.9.2 release date moved to March 3rd
- Two Rest-related issues for 3.9.2
- Some issues tagged as 3.9.2 have been moved back to 3.9.x since nobody is actively working on them
- Refactoring scsynth to improve the API, advantages and disadvantages of moving to modern C++ practices
- Timing of the creation of 3.10 branch (in my opinion, creation of the 3.10 branch indicates that it is closed for new features)
