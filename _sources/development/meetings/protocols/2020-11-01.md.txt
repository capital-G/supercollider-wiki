Present: Gianluca E, Brian H, Marcin P, Hanns H

3.11.2 release
- on schedule for release
- one small build system issue and one crash reported on macOS 10.12 (#5229), found fixes for both
- will do a release if that one issue is fixed

3.12 release
- decided we want to include #5110 (clip hardware output on macOS)
- may move to C++17 for this release to prepare for porting to Qt 6

Webassembly
- Hanns discussed recent talk about porting SC, at least scsynth, to the webassembly toolchain
- Discussed possible porting issues -- threading, exceptions, etc.
- At this point, doesn't look like anyone else can help out, but we also aren't in a rush to implement this

Discussed using labels and milestones to help organize issues
- Brian proposed using a couple labels for priority level to organize open issues
- Discussed how to agree on priority levels and how to go about adopting labeling as a team
  - Would want multiple people to label, and discuss to agree on how to assign priority beforehand

Discussed informal group code review sessions
- Brian H, James S, Gianluca E, Marcin P have met twice to review PRs as a group, to get experience reviewing and learn from each other
- Want to ask more people to join - will announce more widely for the next time
