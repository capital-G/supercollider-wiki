sc3-plugins
* PR #146 has some issues
* It's still an open question of how to best add Faust-to-SC plugins to sc3-plugins
* Would be nice to have a minimal checklist for things that go in

3.9.1:
* Ready to start the release process
* Merge #3469 as last item for 3.9.1 (?)
* Nathan has created a 3.9.2 milestone

Unit-testing:
* Guidelines are badly needed
* A future goal is to move most (if not all) of UGen testing code to C++ for speed and dependability
