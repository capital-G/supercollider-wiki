What we worked on:

- Brian Heim managed to get SC built on Windows and has dug a bit into
the Windows helpfile issue, and has been working on a huge refactor of
PyrLexer.cpp (largely untouched since the initial commit!).
- Nathan Ho slacked off with some miscellaneous changes such as a Ctor
bug in FOS, and investigated OSC v1.1 "compliance."

Brian proposed that 3.9 be delayed until every important issue regarding
compatibility (in particular Qt 5.7, command line REPL, Windows help
files) is fixed, making it arguably the first fully cross-platform
release of SC. After that, 3.10 could concentrate on improving
user-friendliness by improving SCIDE and Qt GUI.
