Discussion on Qt5 vs Qt6:
In the discussion it seemed that we were leaning towards revisiting Qt6 support in 2024 and move to Qt6 dropping support for Qt5. 
Dropping Qt5 will mean dropping support for some platforms (Ubuntu 20.04, macOS <10.14 (the legacy build), Windows 32-bit).  
For future reference: [here is the branch that supports both Qt5 and Qt6](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/tree/topic/qt6-02-webengine) but the work is incomplete. This should provide a good reference for necessary C++ changes for when we actually move to Qt6.

Comments about Windows support -  IPC issues etc; in general SC could work better on Windows...
