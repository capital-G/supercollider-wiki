Discussion on migration to Qt6: trying to decide between maintaining a mixed Qt5/Qt6 support and moving straight to Qt6. Raised points about platform support for Qt6, which would delay the move to Qt6-only approach. Considered maintaining Qt5 compatibility in a separate branch/fork, or gradually migrating to Qt6-only support in a separate branch. The decision on the approach to be discussed with the wider dev community.
