# 2017-01-07



Development progress:

- Tom Murphy: started PlayBuf 2017 proposal, currently reading through
scsynth and supernova code.
- Brian Heim: generally exploring the code base, especially sclang;
submitted miscellaneous help file fixes; found a mysterious bug possibly
related to GC.
- Nathan Ho: lots of class lib and help miscellany.
- Scott Carver: connection quark, finishing up Qt menus, discussions
with the ATK devs about splitting from sc3-plugins.

Everything else we discussed, in roughly chronological order:

- Probably release beta for 3.9 in April.
- Scott discussed progress on the QtWebKit -> QtWebEngine port, which
faces difficulties due to the asynchronous nature of QtWebEngine.
- Code review and better docs for core features that need to work, like
GC and SynthDef optimization.
- Mounting complaints that SC is getting slower.
- Nathan should break the ice on unit tests by writing "pinning" tests
for UGens to guard against accidental behavior changes.
- Getting more people involved in Windows development, esp. fixing that
blasted help file bug.
- Ron Kuivila had some general comments:
     - Confusing abstractions in the Patterns system, such as the
opaqueness of EventStreamPlayers.
     - Making SCIDE more user-friendly. A larger pool of built-in
SynthDefs and/or integration with sccode.org.
     - Embedding sclang in Max, better connectivity to openFrameworks.
- TCP vs. UDP: create a new quark for automated benchmarking to allow
easy testing across different systems.
- Website improvements. Redesign can probably wait until later, but we
definitely need better resources for users interested in development.
- Brian volunteered to lead a "documentation drive" to help drum up more
user participation. Establish guidelines on how to write good help
files. Don't request minor changes like typo fixes on help PRs, just
merge and
