We're back !!!!!!!!

Merged #4105, an important issue for 3.10.

3.10.0-rc1 is ready. Between 3.10-rc1 and 3.10, only help fixes should be done.

We should take a look at #4137 soon.

Thanks to Scott C, UnitTesting class library issue is mostly resolved.

Nathan wrote a new compressor UGen that is almost ready for 3.10.1.

This weekend we'll comb over the 40 open pull requests and look at reviving GitHub project boards.
