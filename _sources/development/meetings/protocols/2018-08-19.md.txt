3.10.0-beta1 is out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (not announcing yet until sc3-plugins beta is ready)

Member updates:

- Alex uses gen~ a lot and would like to see single-sample feedback for more fine-grained DSP goodies such as TPT filters & ladder filters with customizable nonlinearities, and discrete summation formulas. He had some trouble with HID, which was last touched 4-5 years ago
- Brian hasn't done much
- Scott hasn't done much
- Patrick has a bandage for his HelpBrowser issues, developed a new quark called SATI
- Nathan is working on improving the look of the IDE

Topics:

- We'll be (privately) putting together a survey after 3.10 release to get a good idea of the direction for 3.11, which we hope will be released very quickly
- New forum is going well: questions are getting answered, lots of little mini-articles
- We have tried to get sclang into some major syntax highlighting packages like Highlight.js but most of them have gone without response
- A priority for 3.10 is packaging supernova in the official release for Mac
- Brian's big projects moving forward are improving the test suite and standardizing C++ formatting across the codebase
- Pinning test for ugens
- Rendering SCDoc and uploading CI
- Remaining "big annoying projects:" SCIDE startup sequence unreliability, debian packaging, supernova on windows, command line on windows
- Brian suggested that Alex work on compiler warnings
- Possible new official tutorial development with e.g. gitbook, outside SC help system
- "Clear post window" menu item
- Aaaaaaaaableton Liiiiiiiiiink: going slow, going steady
