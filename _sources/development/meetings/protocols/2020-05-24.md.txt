Release status
- Josh P has had some reports of unsigned sc3-plugins not working with 3.11 on macOS 10.15
    - hasn't been able to reproduce. thinks that everything is in order, but not sure.
    - Marcin offered to test

Release process scripting
- Brian brought up the idea of automating / scripting the release process
    - James S, Josh P, Brian H, Marcin P decided to form a working group for this
    
vcpkg - https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4928
- James S has used it before and offered some advice
    - one issue is that packages need to be built from source, not a good way to provide Qt
    - generally positive impression
- Marcin P tried it, ran into an issue with powershell
    - for portaudio, issue with asio sdk
- James S mentioned asio sdk is in vcpkg, and seems like it provides CMake integration
- Brian noted ExternalProject in CMake is also an option for managing external dependencies
- Luke N and Marcin P said vcpkg support for CI first might be a good way to test it out, and then recommend it if it works
    - James S said he would look into that

portaudio vendoring - https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4928
- Marcin P did work to shift over to fresh, non-sc-org portaudio
- Brian suggested using ExternalProject in CMake to get around
- Discussed tradeoffs of vcpkg vs ExternalProject
- Decided to do more research and revisit

issue management - https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4940
- Josh P wants to reset everything and start from scratch
- Luke N also likes this idea, but said we need to have a policy to avoid it happening again
- Josh P said most projects don't actually run as long as SC. issue trackers work good for shorter term projects, but maybe not for this duration
    - fresh start could give some focus
- James S explained his ideas regarding stale issues and automation
- Julian R said a bot would add a kind of neutrality/fairness to it, but is concerned that closing issues will hide valuable information
- James S suggested updating issue template or other obvious place to note that you may want to search closed issues
- Everyone agreed messaging around closing issues is important
- Discussed a gradual approach to transitioning between current process and more controlled approach
- There was a proposition to have a two-step approach where a bot would comment every issue thatâ€™s been stalled for more than X months, which would explain the triage process. Then, after some other time to be determined, the issue would be closed
- Someone proposed to start with proposition some texts for these messages.

- Patrick raised TGrains PR in sc3-plugins
