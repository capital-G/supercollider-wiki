## GitHub

Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and give us a ‚≠êÔ∏è, and fork if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous.

## scsynth.org

Join the forums at [scsynth.org](http://scsynth.org/). You can share code or music, ask questions, discuss SC development. There are lots of "Topics" to subscribe to from compositional strategies and esoteric synthesis techniques, to IDE language integration and building for microprocessors.

## Discord, Slack

Much activity happens on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nvUsUNkC), along with our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/scsynth/shared_invite/zt-ezoyz15j-SVM7JVul94pxtDiUDRnd0w).

## Developer meetings

Everyone with an interest in improving SuperCollider is welcome to attend our developer meetings! No prior experience is necessary. They happen weekly-ish. 

Keep an eye on the above channels for related announcements, in particular on Slack or the [scheduling polls](https://scsynth.org/t/development-meetings-scheduling-polls/234) and the [confirmed schedule](https://scsynth.org/t/development-meetings-schedule/250/114) threads (threads can be subscribed to by clicking the notification bell icon).

There are currently two development focus groups, ["scsynth"](https://scsynth.org/t/development-group-server-scsynth-supernova-plugins/7978/22) and ["sclang"](https://scsynth.org/t/development-group-class-library-sclang/7974), corresponding to the server/plugin/C++ backend, and the SuperCollider language/class library, respectively. The weekly-ish development meetings alternate between these focus groups and a third category that is "everything". This promotes more focussed discussion, and some contributors prefer to focus their efforts in one group or another, but anyone can participate any/all group(s)!

## Mailing list archives

For many years, users and developers communicated on the `sc-users` and `sc-dev` mailing lists, which have since been retired. You can still search those [mailing list archives](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/supercollider/mailinglist.aspx), back to 2002. A separate [text archive](http://www.audiosynth.com/files/sc-users-archive/) holds discussion prior to 2002.

## Meetups and Events

Lots of meetup and event announcements happen on the [Community:Events](https://scsynth.org/c/community/events/9) Topic on scsynth.org and the [meetups](https://discord.com/channels/813532499262701678/913026497932066856) channel on Discord.
