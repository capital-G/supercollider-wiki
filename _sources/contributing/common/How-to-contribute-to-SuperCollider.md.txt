# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in helping make SuperCollider sound even better! 🙏

If you’re new to this project, you might be wondering ...

## How can I contribute?

SC grows through contributions large and small. Many, or even most, contributions don’t involve writing code. Here are some of the many ways to contribute:

- 🚩 [Creating an Issue](#create-issue) (reporting a Bug, requesting a Feature)
- ✏️ [Updating or correcting documentation](#contributing-documentation-changes)
- ✅ Fixing an open Issue and [submitting a Pull Request](#creating-pull-requests)
- 🔍 [Reviewing Issues](#reviewing) and Pull Requests
- 🏷️ Triaging and [labeling Issues](#labels-and-milestones)
- 🏗️ Creating (or responding to) a [Request for Comment](https://github.com/supercollider/rfcs) (RFC) to propose something BIG that needs research, feedback, and consensus to move forward
- 🌐 [Translating the IDE](#translating-ide) into a language you know
- 💬 Helping and sharing with other users on the various [community forums](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/wiki#join-the-community)

You'll find information on all of these topics and more in the [Contributing](#Contributing) directory. Once you're familiar with these processes, you may have more want more in-depth information about the project structure, conventions, specifications, etc., which you'll find in the [Development resources](#Development) directory.

If you’re new to contributing to open source projects, the [Guide to idiomatic contributing](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/idiomatic-contributing) has a lot of useful information.

If you're new to this project, check out the issues tagged ["good first issue"](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) – fixing one of these is a great way to get started as a contributor!
