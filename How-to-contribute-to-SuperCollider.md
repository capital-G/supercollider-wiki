- ✏️ Updating or correcting documentation
- ✅ Fixing an open Issue and submitting a Pull Request
- 🔍 Reviewing Issues and Pull Requests
- 🏷️ Triaging and labeling Issues
- 🏗️ Creating (or responding to) a Request for Comment (RFC) to propose something BIG that needs research, feedback, and consensus to move forward
- 🌐 Translating the IDE into a language you know
- 💬 Helping and sharing with other users on the various community forums
