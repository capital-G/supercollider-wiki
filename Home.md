Welcome to the SuperCollider Wiki! 👋

This space hosts resources for learning and developing SuperCollider, as well as some community resources. 

If you’re here because you’d like to _contribute_ to the project, that's **great**, we’re glad you’re here! SC was built by many many enthusiastic people like you, and your contributions mean a lot to the community! 🔊

If you’re here looking for information on _using_ or _installing_ SuperCollider, the [User resources](User-Resources-Directory) has general information about SC, installation instructions, links to tutorials, and more.

SuperCollider language Help files, Tutorials, and Guides are viewable online at [https://doc.sccode.org/](https://doc.sccode.org/).
