This wiki is a scratch pad for development of SuperCollider. You are probably looking for [the main SuperCollider wiki](http://supercollider.github.io/pages.html) or [the SuperCollider documentation](http://doc.sccode.org/).

## Developer roles ##

Code ownership is an informal program to help developers specialize a little more. The owner's role is to become the default person responsible for working on that component. They have the following obligations:

- Questions about a component are best directed towards the owner.
- If an issue is filed in a component, the owner should be assigned on GitHub. It can be reassigned according to the situation.
- Other contributors should feel free to CC them on relevant issues and PRs.
- The owner is expected to participate in reviewing and merging PRs in their component.
- The owner should gradually go over the code they own and clean it up, possibly adding comments and documentation.
- Owners should, to a reasonable degree, prioritize work in their own component.

There can be multiple code owners for a component.

### Release manager ###

**Release manager:** snappizz
