Discussed issues around SuperCollider versioning and standalones

Some points of discussion:
- ease of learning - interactive learning environment
- interoperability with other technologies (web, etc, LSP?)
- standalones - for performers
- multiple versions of supercollider
    - dev work
    - possible, but very difficult currently
    - backward compatibility
    - run 'from a USB stick'
- app bundle design
- server/IDE/language search paths
