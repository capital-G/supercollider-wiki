# 2023-10-14


Planned as the "Server group" meeting

In the meeting: James S, Marcin P

Discussing the “Keeping SC evolving with minimal impact (…)” thread on the forum
JS points out:
- lack of a roadmap
- there needs to be leadership within groups
- Need to modernize code >> needs tests
- Development is too scattered 

Ideas on how to come up with a roadmap:
- Everybody gathers every X months
- Prioritize all tasks
- Choose something from the top
- Work on that task
- Check in about the progress at the next meeting
