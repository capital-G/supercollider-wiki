# 2017-03-11



- Brian Heim and Nathan Ho worked on sclang LPC tests
- Nathan Ho also made (marginal) progress on UGen regression tests
- Patrick Dupuis investigated openbuildservice.org and HID on Fedora

Topics:

- Plan for merging LPC test suite: get it to run, see if it catches
changes to sclang, quick review, merge
- openbuildservice.org, while good, is not a useful service for the SC
dev team since it creates a PPA/third party repository.
- Performance on MacBook Pro 2016
- Brian is pushing the Boost updates because it works towards fixing the
Windows helpfile problem
- Find people and get support for the SC_SCLANG flag:
https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/1939
- Mixed feelings on single quotes in variable names:
https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2773
- Backing up SC:
https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2776
- Rational numbers implementation: put off until 3.10?
- Push release date back to May 1
- sclang verbosity proposal is not a requirement for 3.9, but it's
important
- Brian and I share an opinion on the state of SC development right now:
we're overloaded with work, and the lists of issues and PRs often feel
like a huge wall of noise. We've been cutting down on multitasking and
trying to focus on what's important, and have felt increasingly
nonchalant about proposals for new features.
