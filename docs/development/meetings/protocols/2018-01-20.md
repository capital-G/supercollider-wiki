- 3.9 release went well -- downloaded over 1000 times.
- 3.9.1 has 14 closed pull requests, which is plenty enough for a patch release. Although we are not in any rush, we could easily release well ahead of the scheduled date of January 31st.
- Brian has been working on AppVeyor integration, monitoring LiveCode Slack for new issues.
- Unit tests are not written consistently due to lack of documentation.
- Unit & integration tests for UGens can be written in C++ using Boost.
- Various ways the appearance and usability of the IDE could be improved:
  - For 3.9.1, let's just make auto-indent optional instead of fixing it entirely. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to test changes to auto-indent.
  - Embedding volume meter and other basic controls.
  - Difficulties making SCIDE look attractive on arbitrary native themes, and the possibility of
  - Replacing the default light theme entirely.
  - Making the Documents docklet match the theme for visual consistency.
  - Making the Documents docklet match the theme for visual consistency (much more difficult!).
  - Licensing of themes.
- SCDoc regressions
- FreqScope improvements -- afterimage, antialiasing
- SuperCollider installation on Raspberry Pi is absurd, involving manually moving files
- Debian packaging has mostly hit a wall :(
- Adam's Guard configuration PR can go into 3.9
- Release signing
- Travis is back in order
