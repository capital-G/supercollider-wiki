What we did:

- Brian Heim has been trying to build SC on Fedora. Investigating
MacBook Pro 2016 performance issues with Sam Pluta. Details are very
unclear right now due to lack of data, could be a mix of a hardware
issue and a bug in SuperCollider. Drafted proposals for sclang
regression testing and verbosity.
- Nathan Ho made a small amount of progress on UGen regression testing
with an NRT mode version of loadToFloatArray.
- Tom Murphy has been reading the server code.

Topics:

- Boost submodules again
- Method table issue:
