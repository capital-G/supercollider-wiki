Discussion Topics:

- Issue 3396
    - Scott thinks this is a Qt problem and may not be under our control

- Julian: could we unify the code editor and help browser?
    - Scott: would take a lot of rebuilding; possible as a big project; could make a rich-text webview using existing open-source editors

- Scott C's PR to update the help browser to QtWebEngine
    - Allows us to move to newer versions of Qt
    - Also fixes HiDPI-related issues
    - Qt Menu addition would ideally be merged not long after

- Qt Menu idea - could make it easier to add system menu items for the IDE from sclang

- Julian: would like to add more examples to Help system
    - Scott: been doing overview-type work, have examples for WebView

- Making it easier to submit bugs/changes from the Help Browser

- CMake: update to 3.x because of Ableton Link PR
    - Scott: use CMake 3.9.4 (what we have on Travis)
    - Make sure smiarx gets credit
    - Patrick: maybe 3.5 (Ubuntu) or 3.7 (Debian)
    - Scott: be transparent about what we use on Travis

- Scott: create a "template" for repos to easily make your own repo w/ auto-released binaries
    - Make easy alternatives if we're going to say no

- Do a better job of announcing/promoting 3.10 and its improvements
    - Get links to Eli Fieldsteel's tutorials
    - Get links to the DX7 project
    - Show how to link to other DAWs
