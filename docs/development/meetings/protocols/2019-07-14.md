Members Present: Patrick Dupuis, Nathan Ho, Geoffroy Montel, Marcin PÄ…czkowski, James Surgenor

Geoffroy worked on fixing the Cmd+Q problem on macOS but has not yet been successful in debugging it (#4300).

Following last week's discussion, Marcin split his huge PR into a bunch of smaller PRs and will be responding to the code review Brian gave in #4475.

Patrick tested #4267 (SCIDE crash when opening up a second simultaneous instance, JavaScript errors when running HelpBrowser outside the IDE). He's been investigating HelpBrowser in command line sclang, but #4267 doesn't fix it. He also went through the guide on the wiki for building SC on Fedora and updated it.

James has been working on fuzzy array comparisons pull request.

3.10.3 drags on. The set of changes in the changelog is not particularly substantial, but code signing issues on macOS *are* potentially urgent enough for 3.10.3. We also discussed similar permissions-related issues on Windows, which Geoffroy has been looking into (https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4368).

Nathan is halting the RFC proposal until 3.10.3 is out.
