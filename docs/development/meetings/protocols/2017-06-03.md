# 2017-06-03



- Brian finished the breadcrumbs link issues and filesystem UTF-8 support.
- Nathan didn't do much aside from participating in discussions

topics:

- we merged 10 pull requests and closed 16 issues this week! holy hell!
- Rest refactor is pretty much ready. Nathan should review it, merge within the next week, and we can then do a post-mortem
- current open discussions regarding style guides, and issues with design by committee in free software communities
- should we really dedicate time to sc3-plugins?
