Members present - Marcin, Iannis, Patrick, Josh

Marcin recent work:

- cmake and verifyApp
- verify app turned of for Qt 5.9 for legacy build

3.12:

- ImageLoader::link in server start failure - what is this doing??? - Josh and Brian to check on this for the scsynth failure to start on older MacOS

Josh to look at MIDI PR - https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4725

Iannis - looked at sclang - simpler Condition - 
	- what methods are essential and what do they do?
	- Brian? Can there be a time to sync with Iannis?
- Something similar to DispatchGroup in Swift for Condition?

Patrick - 
	- Rust: Sorcerer crate
	- Deferred on scsynth may be good for Condition refactoring
	- Does it pertain to: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5363 ?

Discussion of how UnitTest::wait should work, and reverting / avoiding changes for Condition / UnitTest, etc., after 3.12

Patrick and Marcin discuss reopening https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5363

Patrick explains the change introduced in https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/commit/2aa3374e1e52b7db3f7708498810dc6032a1d082 that broke tests; Patrick’s PR reverts this back to using a function as the “condition” argument for UnitTest -wait

There’s an ongoing work on making UnitTest use a Condition instead, but this will likely result in larger rewrite: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/5368

Marcin supports reopening 5363 to get the current functionality back (and tests passing) in the interim

Current plan: discuss this further at the next meeting, particularly getting input from Brian

Marcin talks about proposed SC_VERSION improvements. Will create an RFC.

Ianni asks about an issue with Quarks installation and permission issues writing to the yaml file (Arch Linux) - will post question to the forum.
