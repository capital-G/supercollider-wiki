- libsndfile will build for older builds, (legacy) 
- make a new RC
- need to fix CI
- automate signing? This sucks …

- John’s sc-el PR - 
	- Mac OS - no pre-package sc-el library (unlike Linux)
	- doesn’t work for any other platform unless you modify the source code - not ideal
	- cmake translates install path as a constant defined in one of the files
	- cmake generated variables - make files expect SC as a dependency 
	- PR tries to make this more configurable
	- update the PR to make these changes optional with a flag - the old install path will have a kind of ‘manual deprecation’
