Members present: Brian, Nathan, Patrick, Scott Carver

Recent work:
- Nathan wrote NHHall UGen -> sc3-plugins, wrote a spec for antialiasing UGens
- Scott has been working with pattern library and thinking about improving consistency w/ multichannel expansion
- Patrick has submitted some small and helpful PRs
- Brian has reviewed some PRs and has ported SerialPort to Windows

Topics:
- Denormals - we want them to be always flushed, but it sounds like on ARM (and sometimes on x86) they aren't (reported by Nathan)
- HOAUGens - Patrick will help move this PR through
    - need to remove the units that don't build on other platforms
- Scott has been working with ATK members on their HOA generators - may be a better HOA implementation for SC project

3.10:
- Target goals: Qt update, Qt Menu support, SerialPort port, UnitTest/Quarks issue, LinkClock
- Release mode when?: will revisit soon

3.9.4:
- discussed possibility. Nathan is unconvinced of the need for this, will possibly revisit.

Norns/Embedded:
- recent popularity bump. Should work on improving tutorials
- interest in SC on embedded devices may be ramping up
- consider focusing on improving RPi-SC experience for 3.11 (in the same way 3.9/3.10 were about improving Windows experience)

Documentation:
- Brian has an "edit this doc on GitHub" button

Bela:
Bela has a remedy (not a complete fix) for this nasty issue when building without Qt: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2144.  This is a pretty bad issue especially as SC finds use in embedded systems like the Norns. Maybe the Bela team's patch should be merged in?

Another important performance issue for embedded SC: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3524

Scott offered to reach out to the Monome, TidalCycles, and Sonic Pi teams via email and improve communication with big commercial and open-source projects.

Pushed 3.10 milestone due date to June 30th
