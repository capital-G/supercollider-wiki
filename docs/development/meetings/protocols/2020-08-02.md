Discussed 3.11.1 release
- Discussed PR #5113, agreed that we can move forward with release now
- Brian said they would move forward with the release process after the meeting
- Luke wrote a script to notarize and codesign macOS binary on Travis
- Discussed design of script and how we could adapt it (especially regard build time limit on Travis)
- Discussed whether SuperCollider as an org could purchase an org certificate from Apple, probably has legal issues

Discussed issue of many GitHub accounts having admin access to the organization (some without 2FA)

Discussed whether to change master->main before or after the release
- Agreed to do it after release since release is high priority and we don't want any issues potentially arising from changing default branches during the release process
- Discussed GitHub and git changing their behavior around this as well

sc3-plugins and codesigning:
- Josh said we weren't able to get a release out for 3.11 because of sign/unsigned binaries
- Possibility of creating a single binary plugin that someone could use to load all of the plugins once
- Josh hasn't had a successful way to download & load plugins in the signed binary
- Brian and Josh said they would work together to try to debug this this week

Clare and Brian discussed release automation & pair programming within the next few weeks

Patrick brought up a Ctk quark pull request

Discussed Quarks best practices and creating a "best practices" document, and/or an example repo

Discussed GUI/headless builds and conditional compilation

Discussed JetBrains product licenses expiring

Discussed macOS 11 (Big Sur) and SC compatibility

Discussed post-release ideas:
- Making shared project priorities more visible for new & current contributors
- Patrick wants to discuss after the 3.11.1 release when/how we should do the next release
- When to do 3.12? - supernova on Windows is probably 'the big feature'
- Doing more regular/cadenced releases?
