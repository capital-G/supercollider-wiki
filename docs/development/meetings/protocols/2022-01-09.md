Marcin, Josh, Christof, James S, Nathan, Keithton

3.12.2 - released!

initial topics to discuss:
 - 3.13
 - Qt 6
 - Rework cmake

Marcin - supports trying to support Qt 5 and 6 for some time

James S - Qt 6 project board: https://github.com/jrsurge/supercollider/projects/2

 - move to 5.15.2 first
 - turn 5.15 errors (from deprecations)
 - then moving to 6

How best to support the older systems (back to 5.13, maybe back to 5.9?)

Maybe make a request for others to help? Scott C?

Alternative to Qt:
NGui?  https://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140
Nanogui https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/nanogui
imgui https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
sciter https://sciter.com/
QML and QtQuick ?

Other languages as front ends?
 - timing and garbage collection
 
Synthdef optimization on the server! (Nathan)

C API for whatever is made later - lack of ability to extend the language with plugins is a pain point
