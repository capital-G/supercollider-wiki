# 2017-02-25



- Brian Heim has been working on regression tests for lexer/parser/compiler, which will ensure that changes such as #2673 and #52 can be safely fixed. Also started work on refactoring Document.
- Nathan Ho didn't do much, aside from starting to replace OSCpathResponder, etc. with OSCFunc.
- Luca Danieli has been working with Scott Wilson on making it easier to extend the IDE.

Topics:

- Migrating Contributing page from website to the repository itself
- Introducing a new issue template
- The changelog has gotten too long, time to clean out entries before 3.6.6
