Discussed PRs:

- Tilde expansion on windows 5431
- WebAssembly 5571 - close with comment - issue of maintainability
- Themes for docs 5487 - lots of tech debt; e.g. generating css in sclang would be better
- UDP socket #5747
- Clang-format in docker: Discussion on upgrading clang-format-8 to a newer version
- create duplicated window only on forceCreate 5549

Discussion on automated updates to the changelog
- Look at other projects
- reference: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
- Important information needs to go on top
- Consideration against changing PR titles for use in the changelog - will be inconsistent with commit messages
- Maybe the person merging the PR is to be responsible of updating the changelog on the wiki
